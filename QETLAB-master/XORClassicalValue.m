%%  XORCLASSICALVALUE    Computes the classical value of a nonlocal binary XOR game
%   This function has two required input arguments:
%     P: a matrix whose (s,t)-entry gives the probability that the referee
%        will give Alice the value s and Bob the value t
%     F: a binary matrix whose (s,t)-entry indicates the winning choice
%        (either 0 or 1) when Alice and Bob receive values s and t from the
%        referee
%
%   WC = XORClassicalValue(P,F) is the classical value of the XOR game
%   specified by the probability matrix P and the binary matrix of winning
%   values F. That is, it is the optimal probability that Alice and Bob can
%   win the game if they are not allowed to communicate during the game.

        b_vec = bitget(b_ans,1:t);
        
        % Now compute the winning probability under this strategy: XOR
        % together Alice's responses and Bob's responses, then check where
        % the XORed value equals the value in the given matrix F. Where the
        % values match, multiply by the probability of getting that pair of
        % questions (i.e., multiply entry-wise by P) and then sum over the
        % rows and columns.
